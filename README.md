[Click here to see the project](https://mehmetcakir1.github.io/countryInfo/); 
<br>
In this project:
* I used mainly Bootstrap to design the page. <br>
* I used async function and could fetch all country information in order to display in my page. <br>
* If you click a flag,you can see the information about that country in the card. <br>
* If you select a country name in the selection part,again you can see the information about that country in the card.<br>
